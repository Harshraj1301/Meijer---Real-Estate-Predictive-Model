One thing that truly impressed me was the wide variety of products available. Meijer seems to have everything under one roof, making it incredibly convenient. From groceries to electronics, and everything in between, they had it all. Moreover, the quality of their products is outstanding. I found myself spoiled for choice with excellent options across the store. It's clear that Meijer takes pride in offering top-notch products to its customers.

First of all some nice employees are hard to find unless it\\'s a cashier. The fellas there are awkwardly avoidant of assisting people as they walked by. I must have stood in front of the fish tanks with obvious interest of wanting to buy some. Waited a dang half hour.. maybe longer. More than several employees looked me and intentionally diverted direction towards me. The ones even walking straight at me!... Literally they took sharp turns to avoid me and continued towards electronics. They were even in the same isle as me as they walked four isles out of their way to there. Similar issue to buying a tv. I asked the fella after he returned from the back room as I stood and waited looking in his direction expecting help. Finally I got his attention by letting him know I\\'m interested in one.. He got a ride bit grumpy with his tone.. I asked him if I could just carry it up because it wasn\\'t too heavy for me. I\\'ve never bought one there before.. he simply replied \"It\\'s my job to provide customer service...\" Probably the most miserable tone I\\'ve heard come out of retail. I said \"Okay, right.. I just want to know how to go about this, I\\'d hate to distrub anyone.\"\\nHis reply was as simple as \"No... I\\'ll haul it up in a cart.... Ask your cashier when you ring up.\" I waited there for a few moments for him to cart it up, he wheels it to the customer service desk. So I stand in line to buy the rest of my stuff. Told the cashier that I have a TV to buy.. she says \"Okay...\" And just looks at me and slow blinks. I was confused at this point, so I pointed at the TV and told her I was told to bring it up to her so I can buy it. So then she shruggs her shoulders at me and tells me to go to customer service to buy it. I walk over to customer service and I said I\\'d like to buy that TV and pointed at it. She says \"alright\" and stares at me signaling some explanation. I let her know that a cashier sent me over and she was absolutely confused! Nice though (finally) and she helped me out.

And wanted to know what the status was.but two weeks prior I called and asked that if they would have it in stock on the 12th and they told me yes they would.  it would be a first come first serve. they had an ad that came in a newspaper that said PlayStation 5 would be in stores on November 12th. I waited around 30 minutes to get customer service and finally a manager came out and said that the truck did not come with the PS5s and then I could try tomorrow. Prior to talking to the lady a young man came up by the desk and I wasn't really paying attention to what he was doing but he had a PS5 controller in his hand still in the box and he said it was for a customer when he seen me noticed it.  There is also a bunch of male employees rushing in and out of the back. I arrived early to camp out at 4:45.  I watch numerous people come up to the door and ask if they have the PS5 before the store was open all got turned away. Today when I was going to go pick up my PS5 I was told that there was none not twice  but three times and just couldn't wrap my head around it and believe it after I seen that PlayStation 5 controller the other day.  The manager I talked to in the morning really wanted to know who the person was that I seen with the controller. Because they knew he messed up. They also told me that there is no pre-orders in the back. My guess is that all the PlayStations got sold to the employees.

All open registers were full, even the self scan!   After checking out,  I know had to walk back to the opposite end of the store because I had parked on that end.  Why did I park on the non-good end?  Because that is where the clothing and shoes are.  It would be simple for Meijer to have had one self scan register open and one with a cashier.
