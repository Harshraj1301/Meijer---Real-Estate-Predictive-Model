Number 1 ...some of the aisles have been moved closer together to where as two carts cannot fit side by side allowing inconsiderate people to block an entire aisle and you know the world is full of inconsiderate people. Number 2.... increased number of self checkouts decreased number of human checkouts. I am not using a self-checkout and putting a human out of a job. But for those of you that have no problem with that, Â I hope they come for your job next.

Should I insist the cashier show me their ID so I know they are old enough to sell alcohol ? BTW this is the only Meijer I have been to that does this.

The punchline - I was charged and received NO toilet paper! I emailed customer service, and texted back to the pick-up number. Customer service never replied.The local store called when they got my text and took all the details. The woman on the phone promised to escalate it to a customer service manager at the store, and I heard back again shortly. Jennifer said to wait and see if customer service email fixed it, but just in case she took my address and promised to follow-up and send me a gift card to compensate for the toilet paper (she couldn't adjust the amount already charged).Long story short - Jennifer rocks and I used my gift card today to get the rest of my Thanksgiving needs.

It has never been the nicest looking store or had the best merchandise but that's not what they trade on. The are about convenience. I come here often for groceries. If there is something they do well, it's their groceries. Good selection, decent prices, and always open.The best I can do is list what they do well and what they don't.Do Well:1 - Hours: They are 24-hour. Can't do better than that.2 - Groceries: Good selections and well kept.3 - Registers: While in peak times, the lines can get long, they are usually good about keeping enough registers open.Do Not:1 - Staff can run from very helpful, to not terribly helpful. Not rude but uninformed sometimes.2 - Store can be disorganized. It is a huge place, so it would be very hard to keep it perfectly organized all the time, but sometime it seems as if they just don't put disorganized shelves back how they should go.3 - Not a place with high-end things. Always has had the feel of a place with mid to low end bargain merch. In the end, I go here often for bottle returns and groceries. If I need a press-board bookshelf, or cheap folding chairs, this is a place for that. Great for emergencies, especially at 2am. But will never be a Target.But it IS much better than Wal-Mart.

They have the money to stock DKNY, yet raised the price on cotton rounds by $0.50 in August 2023?? Friggin cotton rounds??Plus, they're leaning more towards bulk sales now. Like... ""buy five 8ct soaps, get $5 off!"" If I wanted to buy in bulk, I'd go to Costco! As a single woman, I can't afford 40 bars of soap right now! Like I said, I've been going here since the 90s.

While I'd prefer to always shop somewhere like Holiday Market I do enjoy the convenience that Meijer offers in terms of being able to get food and medicine and toys and household crap as well.I just wish our Meijer was on the list of stores they were giving upgrades to. The inside of this place is pretty gross to be completely honest with you. My old lady won't even get deli meat from here because it's so dirty back there. The bathrooms are also always disgusting. Always. Stank should not be wafting out of a public restroom at a grocery store every day for 20+ years - for real. I've also had occasion to get meat from here that was labeled as being plenty fresh but was straight up rank when I opened up the package. Another pet peeve is that I wish they would put in more self checkouts. This location is notorious for never having enough cashiers so, if they aren't going to pay people to ring me up at least rip out those lanes and put in a few more stations where I can do it myself.Pros though are the convenience like I said, the selection throughout all the departments, the pharmacy is always fast, their return policy is very generous and MPerks is a really good rewards program.There are a lot worse places to shop but there are also a lot better places as well.

Until I started picking up the groceries through them. When shipt did the shopping it was wonderful. They were friendly, texted when something was out, asked what they could replace the item with, told you when they would be done... Now you take what you get. Hardly have I been given the choice to substitute anything. I'm not told until I get there that they are out of something. I make orders based upon what I need. If one thing is missing, it doesn't make sense to buy other items on my list. So then I'm stuck with items for a recipe I can't complete. But hey, Meijer got their money who cares about the customer service. That's another thing, I call customer service & they have nothing but excuses & want to push me off onto another department.

Â The staff over all is very friendly and helpful. Â Most of the cashiers are truly amazing and have a great attitude. Â The self check out is pretty good too with not many issues as I was expecting there to be. Â Also, thank you for bringing back the conveyor belts with actual people bagging at the end. Â I felt so bad for the cashiers trying to scan and bag and keep their lines moving. Â Thumbs up to whomever made the excutive decision to return to the old on that one. Â The Cons: Â There is so much to choose from that sometimes I can't find where things were moved to, which can be a bit frustrating. Â Maybe a better map or layout to navigate would be helpful. Â I also found that a lot of the items I particularly look for were out of stock at the Big Rapids location. Â Cedar Springs is by far a Superior Meijers to the one in Big Rapids. Â The selection at Cedar Springs makes you feel like you are walking into a Trader Joe's or a Whole Foods type store. Â The ambiance, layout and selection far surpass the Big Rapids location. Â I do wish the bottle return was in the front of the store as well. Â Nothing like walking all the way to the back of the store with a cart full of cans only to find out the machines are down yet again! SMHIn a nutshell, if you want a store that has more than just food, then check this store out. Â Just allow yourself time to navigate through it and cross your fingers and toes that what you want and need are in fact in stock. Â Happy Shopping!",en,12/26/2023,4,N/A,N/A,N/A

I came in to do some shopping for Â sugar free/carb free cake that I'm making for a friend of mine's daughter. You know, kids have it hard enough these days but when you add in ANY type of illness it just makes it that much worse! So I'm hoping to make a beautiful and tasty cake for this young lady turning 13, whose friends regularly eat sugar filled cake. Of course Meijer doesn't sell these cakes and I'm not a professional baker but if I were I would certainly try to accommodate my customers if I didn't carry something they needed. Long story semi short... you can't SELL a cake board and plastic cover to a customer who is making something you don't? Really? First off way to fail at customer service! Second, I HATE Walmart but at least I can buy a plastic/cardboard cake plate from them!!Update: Meijer contacted me and apologized for this encounter. They stated normally they would not sell their supplies but in certain cases a team lead should be consulted. He stated in this case they would have sold me one cake board and dome. I really appreciate that they did this and they also stated they would bring this up with the staff working that day to clarify.

This poor girl behind the deli counter was working her rear end off trying to help everybody and I could not believe the managers just walked past one gentleman finally came out and he definitely appeared like he didn't want to be there he was actually shuffling his feet and it sounded like he was wearing slippers because he was shuffling that bad really sad place I think the managers need to be retrained and jump in where they can.

I say that because of COVID precautions.I love seeing hand sanitizer through out the store. They claim to clean off the carts, but it's not thorough. Oh and there are so many people who come in with NO MASK and no one says anything to them. I don't expect the 16 year old to say something or the older greeter to have to do that. They should practice what other stores do. One way in and one way out with someone paid a little more, stopping the people with no mask from coming in. I believe it only takes 3.5 seconds for their germs to circulate. I should try walking in with no shoes and see what happens. Lol.Another issue is that the store is always out of things. Not just during COVID, but even before. The interesting part is if you find someone nice enough to check stock, they have it, just holding it. I find that especially true in the meat department. Lately their produce has been meh. Lots of veggies are on their last leg and they have a huge quantity of them. Specifically the colored peppers, cucumber, tomato, small avocado, and zucchini. All of which I needed to purchase today. And why is it that even the good blueberry containers have bad, fuzzy berries in them.I don't know what else to say.

Said they received my text, would have been nice to have gotten a reply text so I would have known. Â Said they would be out in a few minutes. Ten more minutes went by. Then she comes to my window, informs me my order has not been pulled yet and asks if I mind if she gets the car next to mines order first!! Excuse me? Mind you the car pulled up 10-15 min after I did. Having dinner in the oven, as well as being here for 30 min at this point, I said no. She then said the other person's order was paid for and mine wasn't. Odd, I gave the credit card when I placed the order. So she said she would Â go pick my order she just needed me to give her my actual credit card so she could take it in the store with her to pay. Seriously??? I'm going to give my credit card to a stranger?? When the order already had it. At this point I told her to forget it and left.

I went through the drive-through Saturday early evening to pick up two prescriptions that I had called in earlier in the week.. I received three medications paid and drove into the parking lot where I had inspected the medication.. Only to find that they had given me an additional blood thinner named Plavix.. I am already on a blood thinner called for Brilinta .. I drove back through the drive-through sat there and watched employees close the pharmacy .. My husband and I tried to wave somebody down and pushed the call button numerous times... Finally the same woman who waited on us came to the window very upset that we were back..( It had only been less than two minutes) I proceeded to explain to her that I was given the wrong medication she told me there was nothing that she could do the pharmacy is now closed.. The scary part about this whole thing is that they gave me an additional blood thinner.. If I hadn't known that Plavix was a blood thinner I may have taken it and that could've had dire effects! My concern is that your pharmacy is supposed to be people you can trust! I know Meijers Â has many elderly patients and I'm concerned for their well-being.. I understand mistakes can happen but somebody needs to be responsible for this mistake that could've been avoided and could've been tragic....

The Dairy department along with other areas as frozen, grocery, household and other staples can easily be found with their new bright royal blue labeled information signs. *Meijer brands are competitive with name brands with delicious quality and lower in prices of course!*Currently all isles as of today, July 9th are labeled with blue arrows to designate one way shopping to help with social distancing by 6 feet.Great organization and bright lights when shopping in the areas of Beer & Wines.

I got the next to last one.

One had an alleged printer paper jam. The second was in use by a person who had a cart full of stuff and was scanning it. The other had a person who had a cart of stuff and wanted to use a coupon that wasn't for her products. The employee wandered off with the coupon and the full cart person's unit then had an error.

My mother said yes but wasn't sure if the Pharmacy was going by appointment time or check-in time. The employee who was about to give me my COVID Booster, a black lady in her 20's, eavesdropped on my mother's conversation to try and prove that she was going in the right order. My mother tried to explain to the employee that she was not accusing her of not going in the right order. The employee remained argumentative and defensive with my mother, to the point of throwing verbal attacks and yelling.I asked the employee to stop being rude, she then phoned her coworker to fill in for her. She recorded the booster on my vaccination card, even though she had not administered the shot. We told the coworker, a white guy in his 20's or 30's, what happened and he sarcastically laughed as if he didn't believe us. Then he said, ""I apologize for my coworker's behavior, BUT, she was probably under stress."" Then he administered our Boosters. What offended me more than the female employee's behavior was that her male coworker both tried to justify her nasty behavior and blamed us for it.After over eight years of using this Pharmacy, my mother has already begun transferring all of her prescriptions elsewhere. I will never go to the Wixom Meijer ever again.",en,12/22/2021,1,N/A,N/A,N/A

The store is generally clean, the staff is friendly. There is ample parking and it is usually easy to find a spot. The health & beauty section is well-stocked and even through COVID, I was always able to find necessary items. The produce is always fresh. The bakery has many options for a quick dessert/snack or breakfast need. This particular location is a bit outdated compared to other Meijer locations in the area and would probably benefit from a fresher look. The pharmacy staff are not the friendliest. There are never, ever enough cashiers and the self-scan is constantly causing issues that require an attendant, who is always busy helping other self-scanners with their issues too.

Â I chose one close to the grocery entrance, grabbed a loose cart from the middle of the next handicap parking space and walked 30 steps to enter the store. Â Appearances were of a clean, well stocked and very busy store. Â I was looking for Stouffers Family sized Macaroni and cheese and found the ""Frozen Meal"" isle.

Â I'm familiar with store apps and I downloaded the Meijer app, used the search function, found the isle (had been there) and tried to decipher the item location code. The location number tags are so small that I had to take a picture of the tags, then expand them, to read them. Â Still couldn't find macaroni and cheese. Â Walked up and down 4 isles trying to find an employee, gave up and went to the service desk. Â Waited in line, asked my question and was told to go to the isle I just left.

NO MACARONI and CHEESE!Was going to leave (was a little tired) but had one more coupon, for Crest toothpaste. Â It could not have been any farther away from frozen foods, but I found the item and my walk to the self checkout and back to my car almost exceeded my energy capacity .Lesson learned, enjoy more expensive but more accessible handicap options.

We had a terrible experience. I was so excited to have breakfast and we placed our order and waited for 40 min. They brought her order and then (40 min later) they told me they didn't do breakfast. The manager came over and no apology just had me place another order. My daughter ate her food alone while I watched her. Our server never apologized or came over to our table at all and we were never offered a discount or an apology. I went to pay intending to not leave a tip and they already added a 20 percent tip.

While walking through the aisles there were dog toys on the floor in the magazine/books section. Baskets filled with abandoned items (where you go to pick them up located at random locations in the store). I walked by the electronics section and there were about 15-20 carts filled with items just sitting there. I am not sure if the team was putting stuff away because I did not see anyone around the carts. Either way it is not a good look. Fresh side: I've noticed they are getting better at keeping items stocked. I have called corporate 3 times in the past to complain that shelves and produce are empty/bare.

Thank you very much for building one here in Detroit. This store has everything. I love finding deals by picking up the circular when I get my cart. It gives me a moment to stop and look at my list and figure out where I'm going first.When I go down the aisles I know that Meijer will help me with my math, because they prominently features their prices broken down by unit and weight; usually right next to The National brand product of the same type. That is just what every cost-conscious Shopper needs.Meijer has my favorite socks and always fresh bread at 3 AM. Yes I go to the grocery store early in the morning to beat the rush. I like The Fast checkouts and The Friendly clerks who will help you if you have an issue with your register. I have found some of the best deals at 3 a.m. while they are restocking the shelves. Probably because they know putting it out at 3 a.m. will get it out of the store quickly. LOL that's how us bargain shoppers roll, we get it and we go.

I have worked for you since I was in Highschool at multiple locations and I never realized how discriminatory your different locations could be. Maybe it was because I was raised in a way where I never thought much of discrimination in the workplace. I was treated normal and because I was raised by a white family, I got treated different than when I was on my own. Once I left my family, my eyes have opened to just how discriminatory people and businesses can be and how they treat us of ethnic descent so differently. For instance, this location in particular closes at a particular timing everyday! Customer Service should be open and available until 10PM every single night at every single location and store closing should be midnight at every single location. This location closes at 11pm. You don't have enough staff at this location or the one at 28800 Telegraph location. And at that location, the self service is closed. Why is this? Almost ALL Meijer facilities I have gone to in a predominantly Caucasian location, they are always open until closing. But in this one, you make us all line up like idiots and a few cashiers I feel so badly for because they are responsible for getting us all checked out within a timely manner. And oh wow, know what I realized? They're all of ethnic descent too with a few whites who sadly probably are low income. This really is saddening to realize how your company has fallen because it didn't used to be this way! It used to be great but now, you're no different than many corporations who stereotype and lower standards while raising the cost to the consumer! Where is the heart started by your descendent Frederick Meijer? I bet he would be rolling around in his grave! He worked hard, you guys at the Top are hardly working and you let the grunt workers carry your weight! Make all the Meijer the same across the board. Treat everybody poor and rich, white and black alike the same and see how different stereotypes can change and everyone can feel good about themselves.This location and the one on Telegraph also need more employees, that's just a gimme and stop acting like only us ethnics steal because trust me, it doesn't matter your ethnicity, a thief is a thief and even you in the upper community do it to us all the time just by price gouging, omg!!Also, my husband pointed out a very good fact. All the management and people in higher authority are also white. Maybe allow ethnics to have some power too. This is the Year 2021!! It's time for change. What we're doing now doesn't work, how can we change no matter where or how small or big it may seem, how can we change to truly change the world! Yes, it seems odd starting at a store but it's in the mindset and if we start on one place at a time and work to do better than before, we can change our world for everybody and we can all be happy in who we are and in what we do. It's why I make reviews because even my voice with a ripple effect, can move mountains! So, what can yours do?",en,6/14/2021,1,3,1,N/A

For starters, it's the second one to open up in the city of Detroit, bringing a breath of fresh air to a neighborhood that has long been forgotten. Â This location is built on the site of the old Redford High School, and they pay tribute to the school inside and outside of the store itself.Detroit hasn't had a decent grocery store in ages. Plenty of small places here and there, but nothing like this. Â It's no small miracle that this place opened. Â Overall, the store is superb. Partly because it's new, but also because it's a Meijer, so I know they will keep up on the store looking good. Â Everything here is new-from the floors, the walls, the parking lot and much much more.There's plenty of lighting here and a full time Detroit Police officer on duty here. Â The car is always parked out front, with a uniformed police officer to prevent crime inside and out. Â This was a local concern for other shoppers safety, as crime can be a problem in this area. Â Also, plenty of door security here to prevent shoplifting. Kind of like how Best Buy has....a little kiosk at the front with a staff member saying goodbye.They have all the same sales that every other Meijer's does, and I'm happy to shop here. Â Prices are great, and it's a much needed boost to the area. Hopefully, they will inspire other stores to move back into this area, making it come alive and revitalizing the area as needed.",en,7/7/2015,5,4,N/A,1

The manager they sent over was very short and didn't seem to care much. He told me he would have someone clean it and that they do not discount fish at all.

Â I'm no exception, though I'm hard pressed to say exactly WHY this location is better than any in Macomb or eastern Oakland county. There's a couple Meijer's I could make complaints about, but why is this spot better than any without any glaring flaws?  Â  This Meijer is nice and big and clean, and it's one of the newer ones around. But the 10 Mile and Schoenherr Meijer is even newer and that one is somehow dingy and depressing. But that's a topic for another review.  Â  I do most of my Meijering late at night, so I don't fight crowds and can't comment what this Meijer is like during the hustle and bustle of peak hours, but it's a breeze to get in and out of during night owl time. It's just a mile from I-696 and on 50mph Mound Rd. so it's easy to get to and from - or it was til I had to junk my truck.  Â  I really don't know what's so extra good about this Meijer - maybe there's some hallucinogen they put into the air ducts to make shoppers believe it's better when it's just a run of the mill Meijer. And really the only reason I can't give it 5 stars is a general distaste for big box stores and the companies they do business with.

I just did some grocery shopping here last night and got in and out of there just fine. It wasn't too crowded for 9 pm two nights before Thanksgiving.  Â  I just don't like this location though. Coolidge makes too many weird zags at major intersections and this stretch seems like a weird little hideaway, even if there's a gigantic strip mall across the street and just down the way. A secret Meijer seems absurd but that's how this one feels to me which you might think I'd like but for some reason I don't. And it makes me irrationally upset this Meijer faces sideways instead of facing out to the street. I even went so far as to give it a good look on Google Maps. I mean, I get it. They got a small airport and a block of development on one side and a DTE substation on the other so this lot is what they had to work with but it just bugs me. It's bad feng shui or something, beyond big box stores being bad feng shui in general.  Â  I also just discovered the tree line in back which of course is behind the side of the store is a little park with a nature trail that has no Yelp listing.

Â You scan your items and pay for them- all on your phone.Here's the weirdness that is this feature at Meijer. Â Scanned my items with my phone (so far so good) but then to pay for them I had to go to a ""self serve"" check-out, scan a QR code on the screen, have the employee come up and tell me they are required to scan ""3 of your items"" (I was buying 4 things)- and then you can scan your credit card at the self checkout to pay. Â That's certainly not scan and go, nor is it contactless. Â There is really minimal benefit to scanning on your phone vs scanning all your items at Â self checkout. Â The other really unbelievable aspect of Meijer in the time of a pandemic is that they will charge you $4.95 to pickup your order at the store and you can't use pickup for any alcoholic items. Meijer needs to take some cues from WalMart- which has order pickup down to a science. Â They bring the groceries to your trunk quickly, for no charge, and will bring out your alcohol (with a convenient curbside ID check). Â I don't want to go through the checkout nor have the front of store staff touching ""3"" of my items. Â It's a no- brainer that for a contactless experience- Â  Meijer is not the right choice.

Â I've always loved Meijer, growing up in the area, but I just moved back a few months ago, and the quality has really gone downhill (this whole area has really gone downhill :() I go to Hill Rd and Morrish Rd mostly. Â  Â My last handful of pickups, between both places, have had *clearly* rotten produce in them. Twice, I've gotten clearance-priced, same-day-expiration produce, and been charged the full price, as if I was given a fresh one. Â  And Meijer is the only store that does not have an easy way to return/refund bad produce. Â At this point, i think it's on purpose. Â  They send me survey requests, I answer honestly about the food I pay for, bring home, unpack, and immediately throw in the garbage because it's bad-- and every time, I get a response saying it's easy to do a return-- just bring it back to the store. Â If i'm doing grocery pick-up it's for a reason-- having me drive the 15-20 minutes BACK to the store to do a refund does not make this method convenient. This last time, i got some email from some general manager who said to just call this number, and they can do the return over the phone. Â The email before that told me to call the customer service number and they can do the refunds over the phone.  Â  Â  Â  Â After this last order (which was my 3rd or 4th order in a row with bad produce, plus the handful of sporadic ones prior to this past month- At this point I'm probably about $25 or so into immediately-thrown-away food) I called the customer service number. It told me i had a 729 minute wait. THAT'S NOT A TYPO. Â  Â I called the number with the extension that the GM gave me, and it immediately said this number isn't available, try another extension. Â  No, this is not a ""convenient"" way to do refunds. Â  Â I will stick with Whole Foods and Kroger for my perishables. At least in those situations, the pickers try to pick quality, but I understand sometimes they make mistakes, but they can quickly be remedied. Â At Meijer, i'm getting VISIBLY expired and mushy brown rotten food, and at this point it seems like a way to make money on bad items that they know the people won't take the time to return because of the inconvenience. Â  Two stars, because the people have always been very nice. They clearly seem understaffed, and I know that has to suck for the employees.Update: I had to buy some nonperishables, I decided I can still use Meijer as long as I stick with stuff they can't poorly pick. Oh. Nope-- Â they are giving me the most dented cans possible. You're not supposed to eat food from severely dented cans, as the integrity of the can and the lining are compromised, and botulism can develop through microcracks if oxygen is getting in.

I advised them my Dr was off ill and asked why they couldn't contact me and advise me they couldn't fill without talking with my Dr... Â I have been in contact with my Dr. daily this week at his home (I have his cell and home phone #s), this was the pharmacy manager I spoke with. I advised him had they contacted me I could have my Dr. call them right away. He said they don't have time to make 2 phone calls. As soon as I hung up I called my Dr and he called the pharmacy and got it straightened out. In todays world $$$$ rules, I will never do any business at any Meijers ever again. What pisses me off is it's Friday and had I not called my DR I would have waited until Monday to get my meds.

As groceries go, they have my continued patronage. As such, this review is being made specifically for the bakery.I placed an order for a cake early in the morning on July 2 for a pickup on July 4. I went to bed and awoke to an email from Meijer stating that my order was cancelled. I was not provided with any reasoning, just that my order was canceled. I called the number listed and was sent to a directory for the store. I selected bakery and a man answered stating he was from the bakery. However, he was unable to answer any questions about my order and said he had to transfer me to someone else. He attempted to transfer me, and my call disconnected. I reattempted and the same thing happened. I called about 4 times in total, each time having the same issue happen, and decided I would give it a break. About 2 hours later I called again, explained what happened, and he again transferred me to a line that promptly disconnected. I tried again, and the same thing happened. After this, I went through the directory, asked to speak with a manager, and the manager apologized, and transferred to the same man at the bakery who then transferred me to a line that caused my phone to disconnect. I called again and spoke to a different manager who was finally able to connect me to the correct person at the bakery. This man then told me that my order was cancelled because order volumes were too high for the date that I placed my order. This is an understandable reason, but I am dissatisfied at Meijers lack of customer service. They could have not allowed any more orders to be placed for the 4th, sent a note in the email stating why it was cancelled, attempted to correct the disconnecting problem, but the did none of this. In fact, the man that I spoke to offered me no alternative, he just said that the bakery wouldn't be making my cake and hung up. I have ordered from the meijer bakery several times before and have previously been satisfied, so I am very disappointed in my experience with them this time",en,7/5/2023,1,1,N/A,N/A

It's a friggin Meijer! It's not the newest but the recent remodel has it looking pretty decent. The Meijer on 12 Mile and Mound is definitely nicer, but this is not a bad place to shop either.  Â  This was the first Meijer I was ever in. My mom brought me and my sister here a couple of times, back before Meijers were all over southeast Michigan, even though it was a fairly long haul from the house I grew up in, over near 12 Mile and I-94. I was like ""Wow! This place is like a grocery store AND a K-Mart, only nicer than a K-Mart!"" Well, that childlike wonder has long since dissipated, but I'm still keenly aware it's really something we have these giant big box stores in this land of milk and honey and gluttony. Most of the third world would have their jaws on the floor at the sight of this retail behemoth.  Â  Â I most often come to this Meijer after a certain late night gathering over in this neck of the woods, so I'm spoiled with spacious, empty aisles, short lines and a lack of this apparent bad customer service I see people on here bitching about. Yeah, there's a major restocking project here and there, but that's to be expected in a 24-7 store, and I always successfully navigate it. No employee has ever given me attitude about needing a product right where they have their pallet/cart of stuff set up. They move it aside and let me grab what I need.  Â  Today I was actually here when that giant flaming orb was still in the sky, after going to a barbeque out in Shelby Township, and my shopping experience was still basically painless. Perhaps I have this particular location's apparent unpopularity to thank for it as it wasn't too busy at 7:30 pm.  Â  I just started using reusable shopping bags and every damn time I put a new one in the bagging area of the self-checkout, the register admonished me with that ""unexpected item in the bagging area"". When the lady stationed in the middle of 4 self-checkouts had to come give approval for the second time I apologized, saying somehow I only thought that might happen the first time. She told me to just put all the shopping bags I thought I might need there then, so the machine wouldn't summon her back over. The thing is, she just said it in a way like she was just trying to be helpful. It would have been really easy to come at me with a really weary, attitude laden tone where there was a silent ""dummy"" at the end of the sentence, but she didn't. And it's highly doubtful I'll make that same rookie mistake next time.  Â  I also forgot where I parked when leaving, as I'm so used to coming here in nocturnal hours when only one set of entrances/exits are open and leaving out of the other side kind of threw me for a loop for a few seconds. There's nothing extra special about this Meijer but I don't think there's anything extra terrible about it either. I do prefer it during vampire hours though.",en,7/27/2019,3,3,4,2

The customer service is great the people there are so nice. Usually whenever I have a problem in the store someone from the floor will help me out no problem. I even had a lady with an apron on help me on her way out the door one day. But my problem with the deli department is how the employees are treated. I have a friend that works there and I have heard some things about how they are. Apparently the team leaders will leave for an hour or more when all they're doing Is garbage then how toxic the work environment is takes a toll on them. There has apparently been threats made to another employee that their job was on the line when they didn't really do anything wrong. I've heard mention of more things too that the head person in the deli did on some inspection day and it was awful. I can only imagine what more happens behind the scenes that they haven't said.

You can usually find good in-season produce, and they have all kinds of pre-chopped vegetables, shredded chicken, fresh baked bread, etc if you're looking to shorten your cooking prep time. I love that it's a one-stop shop if you need a wide variety of things like home and lawn maintenance, groceries, toiletries, and gifts. The main issue I have with them is that they are VERY frequently out of stock of the items I need. Their bread selection is usually very picked over, and they do not restock the fresh or shelved items as frequently as they need to.

I explained that I was handicapped and it was hard for me to maneuver the items over the side where they put the item and they just rolled their eyes at me.

Especially where customer service is concerned!!This review is mostly based on my husband and my latest experience! We believe we were ripped off of $50 basically!! At first, the line at customer service was moving so slow, there was literally like 2 people helping 1 person and another employee just standing around doing nothing!! When I worked at Meijer, they told us to always be busy and occupied with something at all times so maybe standards are just going down the drain everywhere, IDK!! But I do know that it is really dumb to have all the workers attending to one person when you literally have a line forming!! My husband and I left the line to go get some of our products we needed!! I wish we hadn't come back!! We were checked out nicely by someone at the register and asked for cash back there too, which she actually gave us because I put the cash directly in my purse pouch!! We still needed a little extra cash though because they do have a limit with each transaction so when we got two money orders, we requested the $50 and my husband paid by debit!! He didn't give us the change at that time and it should have made me wonder because usually they give you the cash and then later give you the money order alone and the receipt but somehow I just guess I was thinking it would all be together!! Well, I must have had my head in the clouds or something that night because usually I check but maybe I just thought my husband had taken it or something and he thought I had it! We later realized, neither of us had it!! So, check and recheck your stuff people especially at the night shift at this store!! Or be smart like us and never go there for customer service again!! Ya, we got home and later realized we didn't get our change which got us first arguing that one of us had it or had lost it when in reality, he probably just didn't give it to us!! In seeing all the reviews, I see it is very clear that this particular branch really doesn't care about their image or the quality of services and it's sad!! Fred Meijer the owner is rolling in his grave at how far this company has gone since the quality back in the day, seriously SMH, people!! You see, this is what is becoming of American pride and the Greatness we used to be when people will even steal from someone getting cash back!! Ya, they have cams and security for themselves but they couldn't care less about the customer!! They let you report it and we did like earlier this month and they ""said they would call"" that's total BS!! Ya, we may have gotten screwed over of $50 once but you all will never get the chance again to do us! And you night shift workers, freaking have some heart and get motivation!! You have a job, be proud!! Don't work half ass at the end of your shift just so you can get home or go to your little clubs on Friday and Saturday!! Stay motivated until the very end!! I was That Kind of Employee and I was proud to be a worker but maybe I was a very small minority especially in today's standards!! It's sad!! Ya, hopefully you enjoyed squandering our money but just know, never again, you thieves!! And now everyone knows what kind of people you all are!

Â Whilst checking out, I see a gentleman leaving with a huge TV on for lack of a better term a ""dolly"". It was a flat single haul piece of equipment made for large electronic purchases. Â Upon speaking with the purchaser Â (who happened to be a Meijer employee) I get the gist that this particular model is being sold at a phenomenal price. Â Being in the market for a new 4k TV, I go to buy one for myself. I than find myself Â almost shouting hello in the electronic area for nearly 5 minutes before I was serviced. Â Once I was I was assisted by an employee, Â who apparently was stressed from ""just getting started"" with his shift. While he was very helpful with the transaction, Â including helping me clip an MPerks coupon that allowed me to get the lowest rate, Â after that things went left. First of all, Â he couldn't get the theft deterrent off of the device, Â thereby making me have to go through a lane to get this removed. I speak to 2 employees who were clearly more concerned with continuing their conversation than assisting me. ""This lane is closed"" is the first thing that I was told upon entering their lane. Â After, Â I explain, Â I just need them to remove the theft protection device they agree to remove it. Â My biggest gripe, Â however, Â is how I was made to transport my new TV. Whilst having a cart full of groceries, Â I completely assumed that I'd get a flat cart ""dolly-like"" piece of equipment to assist me in transporting my new device like the off the clock employee that hastened my interest in purchase. Â Why did he get this and I have to balance my new TV set atop a grocery cart? Without my girlfriends assistance, Â I would have not be able to safely transport this large 50"" TV. It slid at one point and she had to rebalance it as I still had to control the cart. Â I understand you're busy, Â cool. Â I'm spending money (over $500) that's the reason why you're busy! That's the reason you're getting money! I have been a lifelong fan of Meijer, Â I think I may need to take my $$ elsewhere, going forward. I know for a FACT I wouldn't have had this issue at BestBuy or even as horrible as I feel writing this Wal-Mart :( I can not tolerate being treated as a second class customer any longer. Â The continued slights (greeters not speaking when I come in alone, Â but a smile and kind words when I arrive with my gf, who is Caucasian) I am loyal, but if the respect and ""customer service"" is not reciprocated I can not in good conscious allow myself to be subjected to this type of ""service"" I feel bad because I hit the positive customer experience button upon check out...after the point of purchase I couldn't have given a lower score possible.",en,9/3/2017,2,N/A,N/A,N/A

The retail landscape has changed dramatically since then, and one can see the effort the struggle against mega-chains like Target, Costco, and Walmart are taking.Employees, far and few between, are hard to find when shopping the cavernous spaces filled with everything from groceries to home decorations and electronics. The lack of quantity of scale means that Meijer pays more for things that Target, for example, has already squeezed out of their supply chain and brick-and-mortar costs.I see the attraction to shopping at a local place, but it's harder and harder to overlook the shortcomings and inconveniences when doing so at Meijer.

This location, however, has some serious flaws. First, getting in and out of the parking lot is a total nightmare. With just the one way in and out on 10 Mile it feels like you're driving into a crater. Yes, you can make the argument that there is the second entrance by the Taco Bell, but since you have to pass the Spectrum and the Assisted Living there is still quite a bit of back-up from that entrance. And although it's not their fault, its really frustrating that people cut through the parking lot from all over the place, so those of us that park further out are at risk of getting hit by the people cutting across instead of using the designated paths. Second, if you want produce don't shop here on Mondays. I like to do my shopping on Monday to prepare for the week, but the produce section is completely bare. It's possible that everyone shops on Sunday and wipes out the section, but otherwise it's just a poor delivery schedule. I've also seen a lot of already expired mushrooms, already moldy berries, and plenty of wilted veggies. The biggest saving grace of this location is the staff at the deli. Every time I've shopped for lunch meat and cheese at the deli here the staff has been so pleasant! They never make you feel like you are inconveniencing them, don't act annoyed when you are getting more than one thing, and they double check the thickness of the cuts they are making for you. I really appreciate the great service from them!Unfortunately this is the closest Meijer to my house, and the deli staff alone is not enough to make this my store of choice. I've started shopping elsewhere the majority of the time.",en,8/4/2019,3,N/A,1,N/A

Michigan went into crisis mode with the first couple in-state diagnoses of coronavirus and the WHO's upgrade to pandemic status. I was due for a visit to the grocery store anyway, so I decided to just bite the bullet and go for it this evening hoping it would be at least a little bit slower than during the day.I'd read on social media early in the day that most local stores were completely wiped out of some specific supplies like toilet paper and hand sanitizer, so I was pleasantly surprised just to see that Meijer had plenty of TP in stock, plus pallets upon pallets of additional supplies ready to be stocked.The stockers were working so hard some of them were breathing very heavily and sweating. I heard many of them talking about how long they'd been there already that day and how long they were going to continue to be there.The extremely cheerful young man at the register when I checked out had a similar story. Kid walking up to this morning thinking: this should be an easy day. I'm working, but I have tomorrow off. La! Â He's young and fit and happy to have the overtime, so he's picked up another shift for tomorrow and was working an extremely long shift today. He was very chatty and easygoing, as were so many of the shoppers I encountered.It's a really interesting social experiment to see what people stock up on. My favorite was a gal who had no cart, but just an armful of bags of lollipops.I truly hope that since Meijer's sales are through the roof right now that they will pass along some of their extra income in bonuses to the incredible staff members that worked so hard through this situation. I highly doubt that it will happen, but if I hear that it does, Meijer will definitely earn back some customer loyalty from me that they've lost in the past decade or so of off-putting business choices.",en,3/11/2020,5,5,2,4

Attentive outspoken erratic rude behavior as I was unsure if it was directed at me or not while I walked away from the Deli department as it made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed. I also have a complaint of one of the self check out cashiers as he is a young man as being extremely loud, obnoxious, erratic and a concern that he was talking to himself, or yelling at customers. I did confront him about it as He did not apologize, instead he insisted and said ""okay, would you like to make a complaint? I can call my manager over here right now! And then rushed and picked up the phone with a bit of an attitude. And then I said no I never asked that, I just wanted to see your name tag and to let you know, your behavior is not so well, and you're not acting right.

Â As the closest major grocery store is in Traverse City and I don't want to leave the beach that long, this Meijer's is a godsend. I can hit it on the drive up, no fuss, no mess.Super conveniently located just off of 31 - if you are on your way to Leelanau County, you have to go by here anyway. Â It's 24 hours, so if you are doing a late night drive, no problemo. Â They also sell ice and freezer bags so you can keep your perishables in good shape for the last hour or two (depending on how many deer insist on throwing themselves into your path and how much fog is creeping over the road) of your drive.It's Meijer - they have a good selection of everything and lots of local brands to boot, hooray! Â This Meijer has an exceptional cheese selection too, something I appreciate as I like to keep a good stock of cheese on hand at the cottage for entertaining. Â Wide booze selection, too, but Michigan doesn't allow liquor sales after 2am, so if you get in too late you are out of luck. Â I typically stock our cottage with basics (pasta, cleaning supplies, sauce, soup, cheese, milk, spices, oils, crackers, paper goods, batteries, etc.) for the season for about $200 annually. If I bought the same items at our local store in Glen Arbor, I'd be paying about twice that. Â Cheap gas station here too and, if you are driving from Chicago, perfectly situatued as you should be at about 1/4 of a tank by the time you get here. Gas up here before you continue the trek North as it only gets more expensive as you go and gas stations are fairly scarce once you get off of 31.

After moving back to this area ten years ago, I was absolutely thrilled that there was a Meijer in Mason. It used to be clean, well-stocked and well run. Staff members were friendly and helpful. I truly enjoyed shopping there. After the remodeling of the store began, all of that changed. It is now ever changing and difficult to navigate. It is nearly impossible to locate items, the store is often disorganized, (although it is obvious that attempts are being made to the contrary), and there are often smells of glue and other chemicals used in construction. Additionally, the endless noise of tools incessantly provides the ambience for the shopping experience. Sadly, this store was not in need of remodeling in my opinion, so all of this was unnecessary and wasteful--and there are likely negative environmental impacts as well. Â Friday, May 5, I went to pick up prescriptions for my husband and do a bit of grocery shopping. My schedule is extremely busy, so I do not have time to waste. As I entered the store, I noticed that signs were posted that they were only accepting cash. They could not even process a check. Even though my bank is right across the street, I decided that this was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back and opted not to buy groceries that day. After a discussion with my spouse and a bit of cooling off, we decided to minimally purchase items at Meijer--at least at this point. I love the location, and the employees are absolutely wonderful, but unfortunately shopping at this location is perhaps best for those with a high frustration tolerance who have extra time. I sincerely hope this changes. Â  Perhaps the corporate heads of Meijer need to realize that alienating customers has a lasting impact on business.

I was there to purchase fresh meat from the deli for a weekend trip up north to our cabin and the folks working the deli were friendly and quick.I gave them a 3 star because the place was not the tidiest and gave off that ""Walmart"" vibe. (Not a good thing) I live directly in the middle of this Meijer and the Grand Haven Meijer (Spring Lake) and will most likely only shop at this location if I am on my way up to the cabin.",en,8/25/2017,3,N/A,N/A,N/A

I'm VERY VERY glad to have seen these items being stocked:*French bread (the one with the Eiffel tower on it is to die for (literally) and is quite healthy in comparison to others)*Kimchee*White Daikon Radish*Frozen sushi (but now its no longer there)*Pocky*Buckwheat pancake mix*Organic cage-free eggs*Frozen advocado - yay it lasts longer!But I really want to see more items and more selections personally- I can't hardly eat anything due to health restrictions..... Like these would help to add to the selections. More food for people avoiding lectins such as....*foods and spices without chilli peppers*food without tomato product*food without corn product*food without corn syrup *teas to go without a ton of added sugar (sugar free isnt tasty to be honest).To be honest, there really isn't anything at all for me to eat without causing a lot of health issues and actually finding these products takes hours of searching, finding the products like this is like a miracle. I'd even suggest a lectin-free section in a health-aisle to see if they sell a lot of those products, i'd be buying from there. Seems all the spices, frozen foods and even foods with added ""spices"" in the ingredients have what I can not be eating due to red peppers/bell peppers/chili peppers and tomato.I'd also LOVE to see....*frozen YUCA FRIES (very important to me)*matcha ice cream (very important to me)*taro ice cream (would buy quite often)*lychee ice cream*frozen sushi back in stock, the price was cheaper than the fresh sushi and lasted in my fridge for more than a week (was my weekly supply to eat)*frozen non-fried spring rolls and other healthy frozen foods with less sodium and chemicals (would buy often)*veggie burgers*sticky rice*a more healthy ramen alternative (would buy quite often)*curry with less chemicals and less salt oh my goodness*lower sodium than even the low sodium items already which is a request *echinacea juice*frozen or canned plantains (would buy often)*A2 cow based ice cream, yogurt and cheeses (would buy VERY often)*More chips! Like carrot chips, yuca chips and more chips with veggies that are not corn or potato based (would buy quite often)Pros:*Easy check outCons:*Veggies and fruit spoil in 2-3 days no matter what you buy unless its canned. Sum: i'm left with only a handful of items to eat every time i'm here so i'm always less interested in shopping here due to disappointment in selection. Everything else is fine, I hope this suggestion is helpful!",en,8/26/2019,3,N/A,1,N/A

I don't understand how an entire store with 100+ employees has such large gaps in the products on their shelves.

It is pretty much comparable to Wal-Mart and Target with more balance of merchandise in each department while Wal-Mart and Target cater to certain demographics based on the inventory I have seen in the store.Here, the pharmacy is on the left entrance and the groceries are on the right entrance with a Subway inside of it. The electronics and toys are at the back of the store and the seasonal merchandise is scattered along the aisles. They also sell pet fish, although some of the fish we saw were dying or dead. Poor fish. Not to mention that buying expired merchandise kind of defeats the purpose of paying for it, but I wasn't there to shop for pet fish anyway.They have a large selection of merchandise in each department, though the selection is pretty much what one can find at any mass merchandiser, although they do have a small selection of diverse board games that one normally finds at Barnes and Noble or at a comic book shop.At this location, there are a lot of self-checkouts so one doesn't have to interact with anyone to check their merchandise out, as I did.
